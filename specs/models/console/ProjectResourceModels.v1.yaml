    ProjectMode:
      description: |
        A project can have the following modes:
        - `live`: relevant API interactions will incur a fee and our platform may interact with third party systems
        - `sandbox`: See **Sandbox Rules**. Additionally, no charges will be incurred and no interactions will be made with third party systems.
        - `disabled`: the project is in a state that it cannot be interacted with other than to enable it
        
        **Sandbox Rules**

        When a Project is in `sandbox` mode the following rules apply:

        - A `phone_number` ending with an even digit will result in `match=true`
        - A `phone_number` ending with an odd digit will result in `match=false`
        - A `phone_number` ending with `00` with return an error
        - All other Phone Checks will result in `match=false`

        - live
        - sandbox
        - disabled

    PhoneCheckCallbackUrl:
      description: |
