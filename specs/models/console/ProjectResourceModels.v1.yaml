            A project and have the following modes:
            - `live`: relevant API interactions will incur a fee and our platform may interact with third party systems
            - `sandbox`: See **Sandbox Rules**. Additionally, no charges will be incurred and no interactions will be made with third party systems.
            - `disabled`: the project is in a state that it cannot be interacted with other than to enable it
            
            **Sandbox Rules**

            When a Project is in `sandbox` mode the following rules apply:

            - A `phone_number` ending with an even digit will result in `match=true`
            - A `phone_number` ending with `00` with return an error
            - All other Phone Checks will result in `match=false`
