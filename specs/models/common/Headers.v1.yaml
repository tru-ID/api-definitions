    x-4auth-security:
      name: 'Authorization'
      in: header
      description: |
        To be used for [HTTP message signing authentication](/docs/authentication#signed) in the verification that the callback came from the tru.ID platform and was signed with a tru.ID private key and thus can be read with a tru.ID public key.

        The value for the header is in the format `Signature keyId="{key_id}",algorithm="{algorithm_value}",headers="{headers_value}",signature="{signature_value}"`.

        - `keyId` - identifies the public key to be used to check the `signature`
        - `algorithm` - the algorithm used to craete the `signature`
        - `headers` - the header content used in the generation of the `signature`. `headers` contains the following which should be converted to real values:
          - `(request-target)` - the request method and the path and query of the effective request URI ([examples](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-00#section-2.4))
          - `host` - the value of `Host` header
          - `date` - the value of `Date` header
          - `x-4auth-callback` - the value of `x-4auth-callback` header
          - `digest` - the value of `Digest` header
        - `signature` - the signiture for the signed request

        For more details see [Signed HTTP Messages](/docs/authentication#signed).

      description: |
        The body contents hashed with the algoritm identified in the `Signature` header by `algorithm={algoritm_value}` and then Base64 encoded. For example, `digest: SHA-256=hex(SHA256(Body))`.
